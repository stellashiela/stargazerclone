                A <b>star</b> is a luminous <i>spheroid</i> of <i>plasma</i> held together by <i>self-gravity</i>.<sup>[1]</sup> 
                <u>The nearest star to Earth is the Sun</u>. 
                Many other stars are visible to the naked eye at night; their immense distances from Earth make them appear as fixed points of light. 
                The most prominent stars have been categorised into constellations and <i>asterisms</i>, and many of the brightest stars have proper names. 
                Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. 
                <mark>The observable universe contains an estimated 10<sup>22</sup> to 10<sup>24</sup> stars.</mark> 
                Only about 4,000 of these stars are visible to the naked eye—all within the <i>Milky Way galaxy</i>.<sup>[2]</sup>
            </p>
            <p>
                A <b>star's life</b> begins with the <i></i>>gravitational collapse<<i></i>> of a <i></i>>gaseous nebula<<i></i>> of material largely comprising <i></i>>hydrogen<<i></i>>, <i></i>>helium<<i></i>>, and trace heavier elements. 
                <mark>Its total mass mainly determines its evolution and eventual fate.</mark> 
                A star shines for most of its active life due to the <i>thermonuclear</i> fusion of <i>hydrogen</i> into <i>helium</i> in its core. 
                This process releases energy that traverses the star's interior and radiates into outer space. 
                At the end of a star's lifetime as a fusor, its core becomes a stellar remnant: a <u>white dwarf</u>, a <u>neutron star</u>, or—if it is sufficiently massive—a <u>black hole</u>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b><i>Stellar nucleosynthesis</i></b> in stars or their remnants creates almost all naturally occurring chemical elements heavier than <i>lithium</i>. 
                Stellar mass loss or <i>supernova</i> explosions return chemically enriched material to the interstellar medium. 
                <mark>These elements are then recycled into new stars. </mark>
                Astronomers can determine stellar properties—including mass, age, metallicity (chemical composition), variability, distance, and motion through space—by carrying out observations of a star's apparent brightness, spectrum, and changes in its position in the sky over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                <mark>Stars can form <b><i>orbital systems</i></b> with other astronomical objects,</mark> as in planetary systems and star systems with two or more stars. 
                When two such stars orbit closely, their gravitational interaction can significantly impact their evolution. 
                Stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound structure, such as a star cluster or a galaxy.

            <h2>Etymology</h2>    
            <p>
                The word "star" ultimately derives from the Proto-Indo-European root "h₂stḗr" also meaning star, but further analyzable as h₂eh₁s- ("to burn", also the source of the word "ash") + -tēr (agentive suffix). Compare Latin stella, Greek aster, German Stern. Some scholars[who?] believe the word is a borrowing from Akkadian "istar" (Venus). "Star" is cognate (shares the same root) with the following words: asterisk, asteroid, astral, constellation, Esther.[3]

            <h2>Observation history</h2>
            <p>
                Historically, stars have been important to civilizations throughout the world. They have been part of religious practices, divination rituals, mythology, used for celestial navigation and orientation, to mark the passage of seasons, and to define calendars.
            </p>
            <p>
                Early astronomers recognized a difference between "fixed stars", whose position on the celestial sphere does not change, and "wandering stars" (planets), which move noticeably relative to the fixed stars over days or weeks.[6] Many ancient astronomers believed that the stars were permanently affixed to a heavenly sphere and that they were immutable. By convention, astronomers grouped prominent stars into asterisms and constellations and used them to track the motions of the planets and the inferred position of the Sun.[4] The motion of the Sun against the background stars (and the horizon) was used to create calendars, which could be used to regulate agricultural practices.[7] The Gregorian calendar, currently used nearly everywhere in the world, is a solar calendar based on the angle of the Earth's rotational axis relative to its local star, the Sun.

                The oldest accurately dated star chart was the result of ancient Egyptian astronomy in 1534 BC.[8] The earliest known star catalogues were compiled by the ancient Babylonian astronomers of Mesopotamia in the late 2nd millennium BC, during the Kassite Period (c. 1531 BC – c. 1155 BC).[9]
            </p>
            <p>
                The first star catalogue in Greek astronomy was created by Aristillus in approximately 300 BC, with the help of Timocharis.[10] The star catalog of Hipparchus (2nd century BC) included 1,020 stars, and was used to assemble Ptolemy's star catalogue.[11] Hipparchus is known for the discovery of the first recorded nova (new star).[12] Many of the constellations and star names in use today derive from Greek astronomy.

                Medieval Islamic astronomers gave Arabic names to many stars that are still used today and they invented numerous astronomical instruments that could compute the positions of the stars. They built the first large observatory research institutes, mainly to produce Zij star catalogues.[19] Among these, the Book of Fixed Stars (964) was written by the Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi, who observed a number of stars, star clusters (including the Omicron Velorum and Brocchi's Clusters) and galaxies (including the Andromeda Galaxy).[20] According to A. Zahoor, in the 11th century, the Persian polymath scholar Abu Rayhan Biruni described the Milky Way galaxy as a multitude of fragments having the properties of nebulous stars, and gave the latitudes of various stars during a lunar eclipse in 1019.[21]

It is the most abundant form of ordinary matter in the universe, mostly in stars, but also dominating the rarefied intracluster medium and intergalactid medium. Plasma can artificially generated, for example, by heating a neutral gas or subjecting it to a strong electromagnetic field.</dd>
